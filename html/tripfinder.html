      Trip Finder was the second half of final data structures course project. The objective was to use our knowledge of the graph abstract data type to put together a rudimentary implementation of a GPS system like Google Maps or Apple Maps.<br /><br />
      A considerable portion of the project was dedicated to constructing a Graph package, which was a simple API for performing simple operations on graph structure, including insertion, removal, and retrieval of information (successors, predecessors, list of vertices, etc.).<br /><br />
      We also implemented several algorithms to determine shortest paths, notably A* (shortest distance with admissible & consistent heuristic) and Kruskal's (greedy algorithm for finding the minimum-spanning-tree).
