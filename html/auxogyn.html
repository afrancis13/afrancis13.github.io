      Progyny, formerly Auxogyn, Inc., is a women's reproductive health company located in Menlo Park, California. During my three month internship with Auxogyn, I had the priviledge of working with the clinical team during a time when clinical data was paramount to the company's success. At the time of the internship, the Auxogyn team was seeking FDA approval (and have since acquired it) for the Eeva product, which takes a modern computer visions approach to the challenge of determining which embryos are viable for in vitro fertilization. <br /><br />
      I set up databases for user-friendly clinical data entry, and interfaced directly with individuals in the lab at the University of Pennsylvania and executive management. At the end of the summer, I performed statistical analyses on the data, thus bringing the study full circle (data collection to data entry to data analysis). The UPenn study was utilized by the clinical team and the executive management team in the upcoming months as they continued the battle for FDA clearance.
