      In July, 2015, I was accepted into the Honors degree program in the EECS department at Berkeley. As part of the program, you received increased access to UC Berkeley faculty and are required to participate in computer science related research. My faculty advisor is Professor Michael Franklin, who specializes in large-scale data management infrastructure and applications and is the director of the AMPLab. <br /><br />

      The AMPLab has produced some of the most significant works in computer science over the past few years, perhaps most notably with Matei Zaharia's thesis “An Architecture for Fast and General Data Processing on Large Clusters,“ which won the ACM Doctoral Dissertation Award in 2014. I will pursue academic research in fields related to Professor Franklin's expertise over my final two years at Berkeley, and intend to specifically target machine learning programs.<br /><br />
      
      More on this soon.
